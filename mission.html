  <h2>Our Mission</h2>

  <p>
    Spark a Story empowers the next generation of voices to bridge the gap between imagination and the page.
    We are a student-led nonprofit dedicated to giving young writers the confidence, guidance, and platform
    they need to turn ideas into stories worth sharing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through free workshops, long-form writing camps, mentorship, and optional publication opportunities,
    we help students see writing not as an assignment — but as a powerful form of self-expression.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe every student has a story worth telling — they just need the spark.
